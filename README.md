# Hello deno! ðŸ¦•

## Deno on VSCode

There is an official extension for Visual Studio Code called vscode_deno. When installed, it will connect to the language server built into the Deno CLI.

Because most people work in mixed environments, the extension does not enable a workspace as Deno enabled by default, and it requires that the *"deno.enable"* flag to be set. You can change the settings yourself, or run `Deno: Initialize Workspace Configuration` from the command palette to enable your project.
